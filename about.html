            About Me:
            <br>
            I was born August 11th, 1999 in Seekonk, MA.
            <br>
            We moved around a bit, however when I lived in Arizona I got my first PC and began using the Unity3D game engine.
            <br>
            By 2015 I made a lot of test projects, many lost to time, however a concept for a card game prototype lives on!
            <br>
            <img src="images/SSB_CCG_Combat.png" style="width:50%;height:50%;" alt="The actual gameplay of the card game was rather simple">
            <br>
            After that I began using Java to create simple game engines
            <br>

            </iframe>
            <br>
            In 2016 I began using the Roblox Game Engine to produce games based on Pro-Wrestling shows like WWE, and AEW.
            <br>

            </iframe>
            <br>
            These games earned over 10,000,000 Unique users across the years they were active. 
            <br>
            They began being played by popular streamers online.
            <br>
            And began allowing me to make money off of game development.
            <br>
            In Fall of 2018, I began my freshman year at Landmark College.
            <br>
            While COVID-19 did hamper my education with a slight downturn, I was able to redirect my GPA and maintain honors status.
            <br>
            I am currently slated to graduate December of 2022 with a Bachelors in Computer Science.
