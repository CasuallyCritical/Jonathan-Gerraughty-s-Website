            <br>
            This is a prototype I created back in 2015 as my goal was to create a CCG in the Unity3D game engine
            <br>
            This prototype is very rudimentary, however it has a working gameplay against a computer player, and a deck building system.

            <br>
            This is a game I developed in 2017 as a New years resolution: To publish a game in Unity3D before I went to College.

            I created all of the model assets in the program MagicaVoxel, and I created the UI using the (then) new Unity5 UI system.

            <br>
            This project is one of my most proud ones: a complete translation of YouTuber Javidx9's "OneLoneCoder" game engine.
            <br>
            The OneLoneCoffee engine is a bit of an inside pun, as it is programmed in Java instead of the original C++.
            <br>
            Here is an example of a program I recreated using my OneLoneCoffee engine
